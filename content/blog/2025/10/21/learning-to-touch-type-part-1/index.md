I am trying to learn how to touch type and want to document the process.

## Why

- **Vim:** I've always wanted to be a superstar terminal user, and using Vim is part of that. But I don't practice enough, forget commands, and give up. One of the reasons I give up is because I am **shite at typing**, and hit the wrong keys or shortcuts.
- **Ergonomics:** I’ve been trying out different keyboards. I have a fair bit of hand/wrist pain, so I want to eliminate any keyboard-related causes.

## What

The tools I am using:

### Hardware

- **[ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager):** I much prefer low-profile keyboards. There aren’t too many low-profile split keyboards, so I’ve opted for this guy. I will still be using non-split keyboards for most of my activities until I become comfortable touch typing with the Voyager.

### Software

- **[keybr](https://www.keybr.com/):** Seems to be a good way to track progress, and it only adds a new key when you’re proficient with the existing ones. I’ll try to do **15–30 minutes per day** here.
- **[Oryx Training](https://configure.zsa.io/train):** At first I tried to use only the official ZSA training lessons, but my lack of touch typing skills held me back. I’ll return here when I am more confident.

About 12 weeks in.

Still not strictly daily practicing, but I am improving.

## Stats

Hit my top speed tonight! Average speed improving. Average accuracy worsening. 😆

## Learning

### Ouchies

I will rate the physical and mental pain of each step so far.

*All keys progress so far.*

## Observations

- My left hand is a lot tougher to learn with than I expected. I thought I was reasonably ambidextrous before now
- Again, introducing a new key can revert previous progress
  - I finally thought I had B conquered, but when I started typing with F, I basically lost B **AND** C.
    - (**and** D...)
- I have five letter keys left; 4/5 require my **non-dominant, weaker, unreliable, awkward** left hand not to be an arsehole. Let's see how it goes!
- Adding more letters has led to a speed improvement and an accuracy nose dive. But I feel accuracy is slowly catching up again.

## New Year New Keys

Still optimistic I will get there!

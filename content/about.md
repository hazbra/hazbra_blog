# About

I'm Hazel, like the nut.
I'm a software engineer from Ireland

I _intend_ to write a few blog posts, about tech stuff, side projects or my experiences in IT.

## Mixed nuts
I may also blog about random things... so, "mixed nuts".

### Colour Scheme
Clearly I am not a **frontend** engineer, but I am a fan of the [Seattle Seahawks](https://www.seahawks.com)

## omg.lol
I've been inspired by the [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/) ecosystem to blog more than once a year.
I recommend checking it out!
